This is **dragon fruit**, also known as *pitahaya* or *pitaya*. It comes from a cactus species and is known for its vibrant pink skin, green or yellow scales, and speckled white or magenta flesh with black seeds. The fruit has a mild, sweet flavor that can resemble a mix between a kiwi and a pear, with a subtle tropical essence.

### Recipes to Use Dragon Fruit:

1. **Smoothie Bowl**  
   Blend the dragon fruit flesh with banana, mango, and some coconut milk. Top with granola, fresh fruit, nuts, and seeds.

2. **Dragon Fruit Salad**  
   Combine dragon fruit chunks with other tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, kiwi, and a squeeze of lime juice for a refreshing fruit salad.

3. **Salsa**
   Dice dragon fruit finely and mix with red onion, jalapeño, cilantro, lime juice, and salt for a unique salsa to pair with chips or grilled fish.

4. **Sorbet**
   Freeze the dragon fruit flesh and blend it with a little sweetener (like honey or agave) and lime juice for a fresh and light sorbet.     

5. **Dragon Fruit Lemonade**
   Blend dragon fruit with lemonade for a bright-colored, refreshing drink.

6. **Toppings for Dessert or Yogurt**
   Use spoonfuls of dragon fruit to top yogurt, chia pudding, or ice cream.

7. **Spring Rolls**
   Incorporate thin slices of dragon fruit into rice paper rolls with vegetables, herbs, and shrimp or tofu for a vibrant, fresh appetizer.  

8. **Dragon Fruit Popsicles**
   Puree dragon fruit with coconut water or juice and freeze into molds for a colorful and nutritious popsicle.

When eating fresh, simply scoop out the soft flesh with a spoon, leaving the skin behind. It’s nutritious, hydrating, and visually striking, making it perfect for creative culinary presentations!
